      <h3>How It Works: Navigating Your Path to Therapy 101</h3>
      <p>
        Our Mental Health & Wellbeing App is designed to be intuitive and
        user-friendly, guiding you through a journey of personal growth and
        mental wellness. Here's a step-by-step overview of how you can make the
        most of our app:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <div>
        <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Download and Create Your Profile</h4>

          <ul>
            <p>
              Begin by downloading the app from your preferred app store. Upon
              opening the app, you'll be prompted to create a personal profile.
              This involves entering basic information and selecting your
              wellness goals, which helps us tailor your experience from the
              start.
